# LadyBug-v1.0
This was a bold project idea to first design something with STM32 and figure out programming and the Cube IDE later which worked out much smoother than everything else.
This will definitely be a redesign and this repo will serve as a reference for me on what mistakes not to make and what painful lessons I learned from it. 
1. LQFP-48 package: let the fab house assemble it or get something bigger if you're soldering it yourself especially if the solder paste is old.
2. "The output-enable (OE) input circuit is designed so that
it is supplied by VCCA and when the (OE) input is low, all outputs are placed in the high-impedance state." and "The TXB0104 device is designed so the OE input
circuit is supplied by VCCA."
